				<aside class="notes">You may see a variety of different frameworks. And that’s not all of the existent one. Some of
					them are less popular than others. Mainly framework choice depends on your experience and on demands of your
					project.</aside>

				<h2>Reasons to use frameworks</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>reset style sheet</li>
					<li>cross-browser compatibility</li>
					<li>grid</li>
					<li>responsive web design</li>
					<li>web typography, set of icons in sprites or icon fonts</li>
					<li>styling for tooltips, buttons, elements of forms, accordion, tabs, slideshow or modal </li>
					<li>css preprocessors</li>
					<li>time</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">
					so. Why they are so popular and what are the reasons for using them?
					let’s go through this list of points.
					Generally, frameworks include file resetting browsers styles, you don’t have to worry about cross-browser
					compatibility, it is implemented. You just use prescribed elements or classes and they look well on different
					devices and in any browsers.
					They provide responsive web design mostly by using some grid in their base. Your task is to write correct classes
					and your app will automatically look great on different devices.
					Usually, frameworks support their own set of icons or icon fonts and you do not need to write additional links.
					Frameworks provide their own styles for many elements (tooltips, buttons, elements of forms, accordion, tabs,
					slideshow or modal). That makes the web look good with little creativity coming from the developer.
					Using of CSS preprocessors is included, which helps to increase development speed.
					and last but not least – time. Since developers do not have to start from scratch every time. The ability to reuse
					code is a major plus point. You can reuse the basic foundation from earlier applications and get straight into
					working on the crux of the project rather than coding in every little detail again and again for each application.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>disadvantages</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>increase load time</li>
					<li>sites look common</li>
					<li>unnecessary code</li>
					<li>predetermined class/ID names</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">But. there is a spoon of bitterness in this honey.
					As frameworks safe time they also can spend your time. If you are a newbie to them, of course, you will need time
					to read the documentation at least. So time-saving is a really relevant point. It comes only when you start
					getting comfortable in a framework. And that makes you use one framework every time, over and over.
					than sites become looking very common. Using the same elements and classes everywhere make your apps look similar
					and do not include any peculiar designers’ ideas.
					frameworks accommodate tons of different layouts that you'll probably never use. If you are concerned about every
					byte of a web page, you are going to end up doing a lot of stripping away of unused code, which ruins the point of
					the framework and time-saving. So using a framework you automatically agree with bloating your app’s code.
					The last point is about semantic of your HTML, your preferences in code style. Frameworks oblige you to make it in
					their way, according to predetermined classes and elements nesting.

			<section>
				<h2>How to choose</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>support and updates</li>
					<li>suitable for the scale of your project and for possible expansion in the future</li>
					<li>documentation</li>
				</ul>
				<aside class="notes">So it’s up to you to choose whether to use a framework or not. But if you decided that they
					suit you and is doubting which one to choose… main advice is just to analyze your project’s demands. Try to
					predict it’s scaling in future, calculate your time. And look for frameworks documentation, whether it is written
					in clear and all-embracing way or is messy and short. Examine popularity, stars on GitHub, reviews of the
					community and actuality of updates and support.</aside>

					For a long period of time, the most popular frameworks seem to be bootstrap and foundation. So let’s dive deeper
					and speak little about them.
					Bootstrap, earlier called Twitter Blueprint, was created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter and released
					in 2011. You may see it counts more than 129 thousand stars on Github. And they write that it is the most popular
					framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web

				<img width="1253" height="300" data-src="img/foundationStars.png" alt="Foundation github">
				<aside class="notes">
					Foundation released as an open-sourced front-end framework in September 2011. It began as an internal style guide
					built by the ZURB design agency whose clients include Facebook, eBay, and the NYSE. It counts near 28 thousand
					stars on Github. And its main peculiarity is the ability to whip up prototypes quickly, due to the bare bone
					structure of the framework and the starter templates offered. Foundation’s goal is to provide you the foundation
					upon which you’ll design your website.

					Earlier there were more differences between this frameworks. For example, Bootstrap started with Less preprocessor
					but changed to Sass support. For IE8, you’ll have to settle for Bootstrap v3. Foundation was the first of the two
					frameworks to go for the “mobile-first” approach, pioneering responsive design and a fully fleshed out grid
					system. And Foundation’s gives designers more room to create their own unique designs.
					Foundation special for email. Bootstrap -- paid themes.

				<aside class="notes">
					But in fact there is a lot of in common: they both are open-sourced full (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) front-end
					frameworks, both support Sass CSS preprocessor, both use the 12-column grid system, “Mobile-first” responsive
					design, contain ES6 JavaScript components and plugins, flexbox is optional in both of them. They also support IE9
					and include pre-styled, ready-to-use UI components.
					The advice is to pick Bootstrap if you value speed and stability, and Foundation if you’re in need of more
