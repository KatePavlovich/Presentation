what is a CSS framework?

According to wikipedia.org, it is a pre-prepared software framework that is meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language.

But I prefer another definition. Took it from blog.zipboard.co.

A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices, and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.

You may see a variety of different frameworks. And that’s not all of the existent one. Some of them are less popular than others. Mainly framework choice depends on your experience and on demands of your project.

So. Why they are so popular and what are the reasons for using them?

Let’s go through this list of points.

Generally, frameworks include file resetting browsers styles, you don’t have to worry about cross-browser compatibility, it is implemented. You just use prescribed elements or classes and they look well on different devices and in any browsers.

They provide responsive web design mostly by using some grid in their base. Your task is to write correct classes and your app will automatically look great on different devices.

Usually, frameworks support their own set of icons or icon fonts and you do not need to write additional links.

Frameworks provide their own styles for many elements (tooltips, buttons, elements of forms, accordion, tabs, slideshow or modal). That makes the web look good with little creativity coming from the developer.

Using of CSS preprocessors is included, which helps to increase development speed.

And last but not least – time. Since developers do not have to start from scratch every time. The ability to reuse code is a major plus point. You can reuse the basic foundation from earlier applications and get straight into working on the crux of the project rather than coding in every little detail again and again for each application.

But. there is a spoon of bitterness in this honey. 

As frameworks safe time they also can spend your time. If you are a newbie to them, of course, you will need time to read the documentation at least. So time-saving is a really relevant point. It comes only when you start getting comfortable in a framework. And that makes you use one framework every time, over and over.

Than, sites become looking very common. Using the same elements and classes everywhere make your apps look similar and do not include any peculiar designers’ ideas.

Frameworks accommodate tons of different layouts that you'll probably never use. If you are concerned about every byte of a web page, you are going to end up doing a lot of stripping away of unused code, which ruins the point of the framework and time-saving. So using a framework you automatically agree with bloating your app’s code.

The last point is about semantic of your HTML, your preferences in code style. Frameworks oblige you to make it in their way, according to predetermined classes and elements nesting.

So it’s up to you to choose whether to use a framework or not. But if you decided that they suit you and is doubting which one to choose… main advise is just to analyze your project’s demands. Try to predict it’s scaling in future, calculate your time. And look for frameworks documentation, whether it is written in clear and all-embracing way or is messy and short. Examine popularity, stars on GitHub, reviews of the community and actuality of updates and support.

For a long period of time, the most popular frameworks seem to be Bootstrap and Foundation. So let’s dive deeper and speak little about them.
Bootstrap, earlier called Twitter Blueprint, was created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter and released in 2011. You may see it counts more than 129 thousand stars on Github. And they write that it is the most popular framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on web.
Foundation released as an open-sourced front-end framework in September 2011. It began as an internal style guide built by the ZURB design agency whose clients include Facebook, eBay, and the NYSE. It counts near 28 thousand stars on Github. And its main peculiarity is the ability to whip up prototypes quickly, due to the bare bone structure of the framework and the starter templates offered. Foundation’s goal is to provide you the foundation upon which you’ll design your website.

Earlier there were more differences between this frameworks. For example, Bootstrap started with Less preprocessor but changed to Sass support. For IE8, you’ll have to settle for Bootstrap v3+. Foundation was the first of the two frameworks to go for the “mobile-first” approach, pioneering responsive design and a fully fleshed out grid system. And Foundation’s gives designers more room to create their own unique designs.
 
But in fact there is a lot of in common: they both are open-sourced full (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) front-end frameworks, both support Sass CSS preprocessor, both use the 12-column grid system, “Mobile-first” responsive design, contain ES6 JavaScript components and plugins, flexbox is optional in both of them. They also support IE9 and include pre-styled, ready-to-use UI components.
The advice is to pick Bootstrap if you value speed and stability, and Foundation if you’re in need of more flexibility.

Thank you for your attention.
